# Python Notebook Simulator

The **Python Notebook Simulator** is a project designed to help learn how reactive and reproducible execution works in Python notebooks

You can:

- **Organize:** Arrange your Python code into neatly marked cells for easy execution.
- **Execute:** Analyze dependencies between cells and execute them in the correct order.
- **Visualize:** Automatically generate graphs that show the relationship between your cells.
- **HTML Output:** Save results and graphs to an HTML file for easy sharing.

## How Does It Work? 


1. **Write Your Code:**
   - Mark each cell in your Python file between `##cell` and `##` comments.

2. **Analyze and Execute:**
   - It analyzes dependencies and execute your cells in the right order.

3. **Generate Graphs:**
   - Dependency and execution graphs are automatically created.

4. **Share Results:**
   - Get your results in an HTML file, including both your output and the graphs.
